          Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, the Taj Mahal
          was built as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and
          stands as a symbol of eternal love. The entire complex includes a
          mosque, guesthouse, and gardens, but the central structure, with its
          large white marble dome, is the most recognizable feature. The
          reflecting pool in front of the Taj Mahal adds to its beauty,
          mirroring the structure in the still waters and creating a stunning
          visual effect, especially during sunrise and sunset. The Taj Mahal
          took over 20 years to complete and involved the labor of thousands of
          artisans and craftsmen. It remains one of the most visited tourist
          destinations in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year
          who come to witness its breathtaking beauty and historical
          significance.

          The Temple of Hercules is situated atop Jabal al-Qal'a, the highest
          point in Amman, offering stunning views of the city. The site includes
          several massive columns that are the temple’s most recognizable
          feature, and nearby is the hand of a massive statue, believed to have
          been part of a colossal representation of Hercules himself. The Amman
          Citadel is a popular tourist destination, not only for its historical
          and archaeological significance but also for its panoramic views over
          Amman’s urban landscape. The area around the Citadel is a testament to
          Jordan's rich cultural heritage, blending Roman, Byzantine, and early
          Islamic architecture.
